# WeBrush

WeBrush is a web app that helps build teamwork skills through interactive and collaborative drawing challenges. Users share control over one brush on the screen, the location of which is determined by the center of everyone’s face on the screen. Using just the webcam, WeBrush uses Handtrack.js to detect the faces that control the brush as well as hand poses to allow for gesture recognition. P5.js is used to build the frontend of the application and create the user’s drawing. Though it comes with a few quirks in its usage, overall the application is successful in challenging its users to work together in a very fun and creative way.
